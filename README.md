##  Project Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early prediction using machine learning can assist in preventive healthcare planning.

This system:

- Analyzes clinical health parameters
- Trains a Logistic Regression classification model
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy metrics
- Allows real-time manual patient input via terminal
- Outputs disease prediction instantly

This project follows a structured, reproducible ML workflow suitable for healthcare analytics prototyping.

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains patient-level clinical attributes:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type (cp)
- Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
- Serum Cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
- Resting ECG Results (restecg)
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
- Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
- ST Depression (oldpeak)
- Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)
- Number of Major Vessels (ca)
- Thalassemia (thal)
- Target (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease)
